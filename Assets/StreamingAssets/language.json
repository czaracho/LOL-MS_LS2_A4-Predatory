	  "These areas of grassland habitat also provide food for the herbivores that lions prey upon. "
	  "Lions hunt antelope and other ungulates, baby elephants or rhinos, rodents, reptiles, insects, and even crocodiles. " 
	  "They also scavenge or steal prey from leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, or African hunting dogs (also called painted dogs), even eating food that has spoiled. " 
	  "Lions digest their food quickly, which allows them to return soon for a second helping after gorging themselves the first time. ",
