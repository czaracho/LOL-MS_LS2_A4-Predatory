	  "Prime habitat for lions is open woodlands, thick grassland, and brush habitat, where there is enough cover for hunting and denning." 
	  "These areas of grassland habitat also provide food for the herbivores that lions prey upon."
	  "Lions hunt antelope and other ungulates, baby elephants or rhinos, rodents, reptiles, insects, and even crocodiles." 
	  "They also scavenge or steal prey from leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, or African hunting dogs (also called painted dogs), even eating food that has spoiled." 
	  "Lions digest their food quickly, which allows them to return soon for a second helping after gorging themselves the first time.",
